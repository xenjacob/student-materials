# working title: Flushing dollars down the toilet

## Executive Summary

This document hopes to describe plans for the creation of a multimedia website/app, "Flushing dollars down the toilet", which could be built by a team of coding students over the course of a summer.

## Business Objectives

The objective of this project is to create a tool for understanding/visualizing differences of rates of money flowing over time. This begins being significant to (1) young people when they first begin to learn to manage their own money, continues into adulthood with (2) the need for keeping up with bills, and scales into (3) issues surrounding macro-level government spending. We want the tool to be able to handle all three of these cases of spending, informing and alerting the user of the rate of spending in a way that is intuitive and connects to other experiences, so that wise spending can be a shared value in the community of users.

## Background

The project was conceived with a simple challenge, which is perhaps the most central: given a monthly bill, what is a way of embodying and understanding the rate at which that monthly bill is spent throughout the month? Could there be an app or service that simply divides that bill over equal units of time, and shows us the way in which time is money? Couldn't such a sense be useful to hone in today's world?

## Scope

This phase of the project is limited USD and not other currencies. It is also not about calculating income, or balancing income against expenses: it is only for understanding expenses, spending.

## Functional requirements

The app should be a website. It should allow for persistent users, and should also be able to use cookies to permit anonymous use.

Setup/launch page: prompts a user to enter (1) an amount of money in USD as the gross total amount of the "bill", and (2) the period of time over which the payment of that bill applies, as given by start and end dates with the option for exact time. The default beginning time is 'now' and the default ending time is '1 month from now'. Times can be given absolutely (1/1/1970) and relatively (1 week from now). Include presets of average phone bill, average month of US military spending...

Flushing dollars page: the visualization of the spending page should look like different coin and bill denominations being flushed down an eternally flushing toilet. Photographic, dramatic and almost haunting is the aesthetic.

"Time travel mode": The ability to move at a rate much faster than the normal passage of time, so that one could watch the passage of a month in a single sitting, for example.

Multiples: Allow logged in users to have multiple streams of spending at the same time, and to see multiple toilets.

## Personnel requirements

Back-end developer, front-end designer/developer, graphic designer, animator(s), sound design & FX?

## Delivery schedule

1. Basic mockup - The basic idea needs to be demonstrated to be minimally interesting before moving ahead with the more major implementation work. 2 weeks

2. Anonymous mode - Get setup/launch and flushing dollars page working without persistent users first. 2 weeks

3. Add users functionality & multiples. 3 weeks

4. Time travel mode (least important). 1 week

## Other requirements

The time calculations should be clockwork-precise if possible.

## Limitations

Communal living for shared vision - We are renting out an 8-bedroom farmhouse for two months in (location redacted) and paid for 2 months of internet during that time. Six stipends for food and living expenses are available.

## Risks

The major risk is that interpersonal conflicts on an inexperienced team living/working in close quarters would escalate and become so bad that collaboration would not continue. The hope is that the limited time scope of the project is of the proper scale for the completion of a project so experimental.
